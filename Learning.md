Difference between Azure Policy and Azure Locks.
### Azure Subscriptions.
Azure Policies are inherited meaning if you apply azure policy to a RG then all the resources will get that policy.
### Azure Locks
Azure Locks are not inherited if you apply a lock to RG only RG is locked not resources in that RG.
